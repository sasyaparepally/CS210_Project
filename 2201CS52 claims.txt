Files:

The evidence for Assembler including the output files from the 4 test examples has also been uploaded.

They are:
test0.asm:(3 output files: test0.asm, test0.o, test0.l)
test1.asm:(3 output files: test1.asm, test1.o, test1.l)
test2.asm:(3 output files: test2.asm, test2.o, test2.l)
test3.asm: (2 outputfiles: test3.asm, test3.log)

format:
file.o(pass 1 output)
file.l(pass 2 output)
file.log(error checking output)
my test cases
(emu.cpp,bubblesort.txt,sumofnnumbers.cpp)
the output format will be memory dump.

All the test files have been tested and work properly. 

Each of the object files that have been produced are also inputted into the emulator to create the dump files.
explaining each test case in emulator

file to be executed:emu.cpp
bubblesort.txt->It is a n input bubble sort algorithm.In the code it is assumed that n is to be 4 by default for working sample example and 
mem[0]=first input
mem[1]=second input
mem[2]=third input
mem[3]=fourth input
mem[4]=n-1=3
outout comes in sorted order in mem[0-3] positions.
sumofnnumbers.txt->It gives sum of first n numbers starting from zero.
mem[0]=input=n
mem[1]=output

*Two programs are compilable with :
g++ emu.cpp -o emuexe 

as they are written in cpp.
